### **Database Verification (Optional)**:

You can verify the setup directly in the database:

```sql
-- Check active cron jobs
SELECT jobname, schedule, active 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname LIKE 'export_lessons_%';

-- Check recent export logs
SELECT school_id, export_type, status, created_at 
FROM export_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Missing Google Sheets Service Account credentials" error**
   - **Solution**: Ensure GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY and GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL environment variables are set

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:
