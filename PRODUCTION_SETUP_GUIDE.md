# üöÄ Production Setup Guide for Automated Exports

This guide provides **clear, step-by-step instructions** for setting up automated lesson exports in your production environment.

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Done**

The automated export system is **fully implemented** and ready to use. Here's what's already working:

- ‚úÖ Database schema with automated cron job management
- ‚úÖ Edge function for exporting lessons to Google Sheets  
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI for configuration and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Secure secrets management system
- ‚úÖ Export logging and history tracking

## üîß **Production Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Find Your Service Role Key**

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Copy the **`service_role`** key (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is different from the `anon` key. Make sure you copy the **service_role** key.

### **Step 2: Configure the Service Role Key**

1. **Log in to your app** as a **superadmin** user
2. Go to **Settings** page
3. Find the **"Automated Export Configuration"** section at the top
4. Paste your service role key in the input field
5. Click **"Configure Service Role Key"**

‚úÖ **That's it!** The system is now ready for automated exports.

### **Step 3: Test the Setup**

1. As an **admin or superadmin**, scroll down to the **"Export Lessons"** section
2. Configure a Google Sheet URL and tab name
3. Select an auto-export frequency (hourly/daily/weekly)
4. Click **"Save Settings"**
5. Test with **"Export Now"** to verify it works

## üìã **User Instructions**

### **For Superadmins:**
- Configure the service role key (one-time setup)
- Monitor system-wide export functionality

### **For School Admins:**
- Configure Google Sheet settings for their school
- Set up automated export schedules
- Monitor export history and logs

### **For Teachers:**
- No additional setup required
- Lessons are automatically exported based on admin settings

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Check if Setup is Working:**

1. **Service Role Key Status**: 
   - Superadmins will see a green checkmark in the "Automated Export Configuration" section
   - Admins will see automated export options enabled

2. **Test Manual Export**:
   - Configure a Google Sheet URL
   - Click "Export Now"
   - Check the "Export History" section for success status

3. **Verify Automated Scheduling**:
   - Set an auto-export frequency
   - Check that a cron job was created (visible in export logs after the scheduled time)

### **Database Verification (Optional)**:

You can verify the setup directly in the database:

```sql
-- Check if service role key is configured
SELECT EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM app_secrets 
  WHERE secret_name = 'supabase_service_role_key'
) as service_key_configured;

-- Check active cron jobs
SELECT jobname, schedule, active 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname LIKE 'export_lessons_%';

-- Check recent export logs
SELECT school_id, export_type, status, created_at 
FROM export_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Service role key not configured" error**
   - **Solution**: Follow Step 2 above to configure the key as a superadmin

2. **"Permission denied" when configuring service role key**
   - **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a superadmin user

3. **Manual exports work but automated exports don't**
   - **Check**: Service role key is configured
   - **Check**: Auto-export frequency is set to something other than "none"
   - **Check**: Google Sheet URL is properly configured

4. **Google Sheets permission errors**
   - **Solution**: Share your Google Sheet with: `schooltools@schooltools-459418.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - **Make sure**: The service account has "Editor" access

### **Getting Help:**

- **Export History**: Check the "Export History" section in Settings for error details
- **Database Logs**: Use the verification queries above to check system status
- **Supabase Logs**: Check your Supabase project logs for detailed error information

## üîí **Security Notes**

- ‚úÖ Service role key is stored securely in the database with RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Only superadmin users can configure the service role key
- ‚úÖ Only admin/superadmin users can access export functionality
- ‚úÖ All export attempts are logged for audit purposes

## üìä **Export Schedules**

- **Hourly**: Every hour at minute 0 (1:00, 2:00, 3:00...)
- **Daily**: Every day at 2:00 AM
- **Weekly**: Every Sunday at 2:00 AM
- **Manual**: Available anytime for immediate export

## üéØ **Success Indicators**

You'll know the setup is working when:

‚úÖ Superadmin sees "Service role key is configured" with green checkmark  
‚úÖ Admins can select auto-export frequencies without warnings  
‚úÖ Manual exports complete successfully  
‚úÖ Export history shows successful automated exports  
‚úÖ Google Sheets receive updated lesson data automatically

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. Check the **Export History** section for specific error messages
2. Verify all steps above were completed correctly
3. Test with a simple Google Sheet first to isolate issues
4. Check that your Google service account has proper permissions

The system is designed to be self-managing once configured correctly. Most issues are related to missing service role key configuration or Google Sheets permissions.
