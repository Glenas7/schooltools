# üöÄ Production Setup Guide for Automated Exports

This guide provides **clear, step-by-step instructions** for setting up automated lesson exports in your production environment.

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Done**

The automated export system is **fully implemented** and ready to use. Here's what's already working:

- ‚úÖ **Service Role Key**: Automatically available as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable
- ‚úÖ **Edge Functions**: Deployed and ready to handle exports
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: All tables and functions are set up
- ‚úÖ **Automated Scheduling**: Cron jobs are automatically managed

### üîß **Required Setup: Google Sheets Service Account**

You need to configure Google Sheets credentials for the system to write to Google Sheets:

**Step 1: Create Google Service Account**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Google Sheets API**
4. Go to **IAM & Admin** ‚Üí **Service Accounts**
5. Click **"Create Service Account"**
6. Give it a name like "School Tools Sheets Access"
7. Click **"Create and Continue"**
8. Skip role assignment (click **"Continue"**)
9. Click **"Done"**

**Step 2: Generate Service Account Key**
1. Click on your newly created service account
2. Go to **"Keys"** tab
3. Click **"Add Key"** ‚Üí **"Create new key"**
4. Choose **JSON** format
5. Download the JSON file

**Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Supabase**
1. Open the downloaded JSON file
2. In your **Supabase Dashboard**, go to **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Edge Functions**
3. Scroll to **"Environment Variables"** section
4. Add these two variables:
   - **Name**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - **Value**: Copy the `client_email` value from your JSON file
   - **Name**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY`  
   - **Value**: Copy the `private_key` value from your JSON file (including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` parts)

‚úÖ **That's it!** The system is now ready for automated exports.

### **Test the Setup**

1. As an **admin or superadmin**, scroll down to the **"Export Lessons"** section
2. Configure a Google Sheet URL and tab name
3. Select an auto-export frequency (hourly/daily/weekly)
4. Click **"Save Settings"**
5. Test with **"Export Now"** to verify it works

## üìã **User Instructions**

### **For App Creator (You):**
- Set up Google Sheets Service Account credentials (one-time setup)
- Monitor usage across all schools

### **For School Admins:**
- Configure Google Sheet settings for their school
- Set up automated export schedules
- Monitor export history and logs

### **For Teachers:**
- No additional setup required
- Lessons are automatically exported based on admin settings

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Check if Setup is Working:**

1. **Service Role Key Status**: 
   - System is configured once by app creator
   - All admins can use automated export options immediately

2. **Test Manual Export**:
   - Configure a Google Sheet URL
   - Click "Export Now"
   - Check the "Export History" section for success status

3. **Verify Automated Scheduling**:
   - Set an auto-export frequency
   - Check that a cron job was created (visible in export logs after the scheduled time)

### **Database Verification (Optional)**:

You can verify the setup directly in the database:

```sql
-- Check active cron jobs
SELECT jobname, schedule, active 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname LIKE 'export_lessons_%';

-- Check recent export logs
SELECT school_id, export_type, status, created_at 
FROM export_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Missing Google Sheets Service Account credentials" error**
   - **Solution**: Ensure GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY and GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL environment variables are set

2. **Automated exports not working**
   - **Solution**: Check that auto-export frequency is set to something other than "none"

3. **Manual exports work but automated exports don't**
   - **Check**: Auto-export frequency is set to something other than "none"
   - **Check**: Google Sheet URL is properly configured
   - **Check**: Export logs for specific error messages

4. **Google Sheets permission errors**
   - **Solution**: Share your Google Sheet with: `schooltools@schooltools-459418.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - **Make sure**: The service account has "Editor" access

### **Getting Help:**

- **Export History**: Check the "Export History" section in Settings for error details
- **Database Logs**: Use the verification queries above to check system status
- **Supabase Logs**: Check your Supabase project logs for detailed error information

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. Check the **Export History** section for specific error messages
2. Verify all steps above were completed correctly
3. Test with a simple Google Sheet first to isolate issues
4. Check that your Google service account has proper permissions

The system is designed to be self-managing once configured correctly. Most issues are related to missing service role key configuration or Google Sheets permissions.
