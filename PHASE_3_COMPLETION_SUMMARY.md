# Phase 3 Completion Summary: Frontend Multi-Tenant Transformation

## Overview
Phase 3 of the transformation from a music teacher scheduling app to a generic multi-tenant SaaS school scheduler has been successfully completed. The frontend has been fully updated to work with the new multi-tenant backend architecture.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. TypeScript Error Resolution
- Fixed reduce function typing issues in `TeachersContext.tsx`
- Resolved all compilation errors preventing build success

### 2. Component Directory Restructuring
- âœ… Renamed `src/components/instruments/` â†’ `src/components/subjects/`
- âœ… Renamed `InstrumentList.tsx` â†’ `SubjectList.tsx`
- âœ… Renamed `InstrumentForm.tsx` â†’ `SubjectForm.tsx`
- âœ… Renamed `src/pages/Instruments.tsx` â†’ `src/pages/Subjects.tsx`
- âœ… Removed obsolete instrument-related files

### 3. Subject Component Updates
- **SubjectList.tsx**: Complete rewrite with school context awareness, admin permission checking
- **SubjectForm.tsx**: Updated to use Subject types and school-based permissions
- **Subjects.tsx**: Complete rewrite with school context integration and proper navigation

### 4. Teacher Component Updates
- **TeacherForm.tsx**: Changed from `instrumentIds` to `subjectIds`, integrated school context
- **TeacherList.tsx**: Updated to use subjects instead of instruments, added school awareness
- **Teachers.tsx**: Updated to use new `TeachersContext` with school-based functionality

### 5. Scheduler Component Updates
- **NewLessonForm.tsx**: Complete rewrite to use subjects, added school context integration
- **UnassignedLessons.tsx**: Updated to use subjects with helper functions
- **TimeGrid.tsx**: Changed from instruments to subjects, updated all references
- **EditLessonModal.tsx**: Updated to use subjects throughout
- **Schedule.tsx**: Updated from `useInstruments` to `useSubjects`, removed global admin roles

### 6. Navigation and App Structure Updates
- **App.tsx**: Updated routing from `/instruments` to `/subjects`, removed global admin requirements
- **Navbar.tsx**: Complete rewrite with school context, changed branding to "School Scheduler"

### 7. Context Integration
- All components now use school-aware contexts (`useSchool`, `useSubjects`, `useTeachers`)
- Removed dependencies on old `InstrumentsContext`
- Added proper school-based permission checking and data isolation

### 8. File Cleanup
- âœ… Removed `src/contexts/InstrumentsContext.tsx`
- âœ… Removed `src/components/instruments/` directory
- âœ… All old instrument references eliminated
